# Pipelined_RISC-V_Processor
This Repo contains all the files needed to create and simulate a pipelined RISC-V processor that supports all RV32IM instructions as well as some compressed instructions.

The project was built uding Verilog running on Xilinx Vivado.

It also contains the darapath that we constructed to create the processor.

Finally, a folder that contains the test cases that we used to test it.
